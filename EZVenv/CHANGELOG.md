# Changelog

## **v0.5.0** - Released: 2025-03-03

### ðŸš€ New Features
- Optional directory initialization: ~~~ezvenv init [dir]~~~ now accepts a target directory.
  - If the directory does not exist, it is automatically created.
  - If the directory exists and is nonâ€‘empty, a confirmation prompt is displayed.
- Generation of a configuration file (~~~ezvenv.yaml~~~) in the initialized directory.
  - If the configuration file already exists, the user is prompted before overwriting.
- Enhanced environment activation:
  - When activating a new environment from the master environment (~~~EZVenv-Master~~~), the user is prompted with three options:
    1. Deactivate the master environment and then activate the new one.
    2. Activate the new environment on top of the master environment.
    3. Do nothing (abort activation).
- Robust activation logic to prevent infinite reâ€‘initialization loops and false positives.

### Improvements
- Detailed and verbose output during initialization and environment switching.
- Enhanced flag management to clearly distinguish between the master and project environments.
